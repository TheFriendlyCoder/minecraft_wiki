My server is accessible by request only, to my friends and friends-of-friends only. New players who log in will initially receive "visitor" access to the world, meaning they will not be able to interact with anything in the world. To be given full "member" access you must post a request in the group Discord server or send a request to one of the server operators (see main landing page).
