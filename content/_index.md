Welcome to my public Minecraft server. My server hosts a standard Bedrock Edition Minecraft server which should work on any platform or device that Bedrock Edition is available on including PC (aka: Minecraft Windows 10 Edition), XBox, Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and mobile (ie: iOS and Android).

# Server Etiquette

Players on my server are expected to be considerate of others at all times and abide by the following rules:

* Be polite and avoid bad language (we have kids playing on our server)
* Respect other peoples structures, homes and items (ie: don't destroy structures created by others, and don't take stuff from chests in their houses unless they give you permission first)
* Sleep at night (unless all other active players agree to stay up)

# Discord Chat

We have set up a private Discord server where people can join to do voice and/or video chat with other players if they wish, or to help coordinate operations between multiple players who are working on a shared project or achievement. If you have a Discord account, you can request access to the server via [this link](https://discord.gg/Qumm3Dqh) or by contacting one of the operators listed below.

# Server Administrators

Questions may be directed to the server administrators below. Support is offered on a best-effort case only:
