Welcome to my public Minecraft server. My server hosts a standard Bedrock Edition Minecraft server which should work on any platform or device that Bedrock Edition is available on including PC (aka: Minecraft Windows 10 Edition), XBox, Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and mobile (ie: iOS and Android).

# Server Rules

Players on my server are expected to be considerate of others at all times and abide by the following rules:

* Be polite and avoid bad language (we have kids playing on our server)
* Respect other peoples structures, homes and items (ie: don't destroy structures created by others, and don't take stuff from chests in their houses unless they give you permission first)
* Sleep at night (unless all other active players agree to stay up)


# Requesting Access

My server is open for anyone to join, but new players will only receive "visitor" access to the world, meaning they will only be able to observe what is going on in the world. To be given full "member" access you may post a request in the Discord server (see below) or send a request to one of the server operators below:

[Kevin](thefriendlycoder@gmail.com)
[Melissa](ccimelissa@hotmail.com)

# Discord Chat

We have set up a private Discord server where people can join to do voice and/or video chat with other players if they wish, or to help coordinate operations between multiple players who are working on a shared project or achievement. If you have a Discord account, you can request access to the server via [this link](https://discord.gg/Qumm3Dqh) or by contacting one of the operators listed above

# Connection Information

The methods used to connect to our shared server are platform specific. Follow the steps outlined for your platform from the sections below.

# FAQs

## On my console the Lifeboat server doesn't show "Kevin's Shared Server". What could cause this?

First double check to make sure you've followed the instructions for your console exactly as described above. If they are all correct, then the most likely problem is that the IP addresses being used for the primary and secondar DNS servers are not up to date. To confirm the values provided above on this page are correct use a tool like WhatsMyIP or ping to look up the IP address of the following host name: scottyserv.ddns.net. Whatever IP address is associated with that host name should then be used in your DNS configuration as described above.
